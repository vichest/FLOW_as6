**Project Name: CryptoPoops NFT Collection**

Welcome to the CryptoPoops NFT Collection! This repository contains a smart contract implementation for managing a collection of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Flow blockchain. The smart contract provides various functionalities to interact with the NFT collection, including depositing new NFTs and borrowing existing ones.

**Smart Contract Interface: MyCollectionPublic**

The `MyCollectionPublic` interface defines the public functions available for interacting with the NFT collection. These functions are as follows:

1. `deposit(token: @NonFungibleToken.NFT)`: Deposits a new NFT into the collection. The `token` parameter must be a reference to an NFT of the `NonFungibleToken.NFT` type.

2. `getIDs(): [UInt64]`: Retrieves an array of UInt64 IDs representing the unique identifiers of NFTs in the collection.

3. `borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &NonFungibleToken.NFT`: Borrows an existing NFT from the collection based on its `id`. The function returns a reference to the borrowed NFT of the `NonFungibleToken.NFT` type.

4. `borrowAuthNFT(id: UInt64): &NFT`: Borrows an authorized NFT from the collection based on its `id`. The function returns an authorized reference to the NFT of the `NFT` type.

**Read NFT Information - `main` Function**

The `main` function is a public function that allows anyone to read information about a specific NFT from the collection. It takes two parameters:

- `account`: The address of the account that owns the NFT collection.
- `id`: The unique identifier of the NFT to be read.

The function performs the following steps:

1. Borrow the `CollectionPublic` and `MyCollectionPublic` capabilities from the specified `account` using the `getCapability` function.
2. Call the `borrowAuthNFT` function on the `CollectionPublic` capability to borrow the authorized NFT with the specified `id`.
3. Extract the properties of the borrowed NFT, including `name`, `favouriteFood`, and `luckyNumber`.
4. Return the extracted information as an array of `AnyStruct`.

**Usage**

To use this smart contract, you need to deploy it on the Flow blockchain and interact with it using a compatible blockchain wallet or development environment. The contract can be used to create, manage, and trade NFTs within the CryptoPoops collection.

To read NFT information, call the `main` function with the desired `account` address and `id` of the NFT you want to retrieve information about.

For further details on deploying and using the CryptoPoops NFT Collection, refer to the documentation and code samples in this repository.
